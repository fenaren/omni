# OMNI

A very lightweight monitoring system for Raspberry Pi clusters running Kubernetes.

## Why?

When I finished my Kubernetes cluster using a few Raspberry Pis, the first thing I wanted to do is install Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring, and so I did. But when I had all of it working I found a few drawbacks:

- The Prometheus exporter pods use a lot of RAM
- The Prometheus exporter pods use a considerable amount of CPU
- Prometheus gathers way too much data that I don't really need.
- The node where the main Prometheus pod is installed gets all of the information and saves it in its own database, constantly performing a lot of writes to the SD card. SD cards under lots of constant writing operations tend to die.

Last but not least, I like to learn how these things work.

## Advantages

Omni has (what I consider) some advantages over the regular Prometheus + Grafana combo:

- It uses almost no RAM (13 Mb)
- It uses almost no CPU (between 2m and 6m)
- It gathers only the information I need
- All of the information is sent to an InfluxDB instance that could be inside or outside the cluster. This means that no information is persisted in the disk, extending the SD cards lifetime.
- InfluxDB acts as the database and the graph dashboard at the same time, so there is no need to also install Grafana (although you could if you wanted to).

## Prerequisites

For Omni to work, you need to have the `libseccomp2.deb` library installed in each of your nodes to avoid a Python error:

`Fatal Python Error: pyinit_main: can't initialize time`

(more info [here](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-papermerge/issues/4#issuecomment-735236388))

To install it you can do it in two ways (**only one is needed**):

- **Ansible:** *all nodes at the same time*

    Edit the file `ansible-playbook-libs.yaml` in this repo, add your hosts and run:

    ``` bash
    ansible-playbook install-libs.yaml
    ```

- **SSH:** *one by one*

    Connect into each of your nodes and run:

    ``` bash
    wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libs/libseccomp/libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb
    ```

Once you have it, everything should work ok.

## Setup

Before deploying you'll have to specify the attributes of your InfluxDB instance.

1. Copy the configuration template file to the one you'll deploy:

    ``` bash
    cp omni-config-example.yaml omni-config.yaml
    ```

2. Open `omni-config.yaml` and fill the variables with your InfluxDB instance information.

    *NOTE: The attribute `OMNI_DATA_RATE_SECONDS` specifies the number of seconds that pass between data reporting events that are sent to the InfluxDB server.*

3. Deploy the configuration for Omni to work:

    ``` bash
    kubectl apply -f omni-config.yaml
    ```

4. Check that the configuration were created correctly:

    ``` bash
    kubectl describe configmap omni-config
    ```

    You should see the configuration values.

## Installation

Once the configuration is done, all that is left is to deploy the DaemonSet of Omni pods:

``` bash
kubectl apply -f omni-daemonset.yaml
```

Check that everything is running as expected:

``` bash
kubectl get pods
```

And you are done! ðŸŽ‰
